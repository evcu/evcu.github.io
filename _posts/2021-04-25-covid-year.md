I will try to keep this one short. I guess I want to stamp the time while during my last night in Kas. The date is 25th April 2021. I came here (or in general to Turkey) in August 2020 roughly 4.5 years after I left Turkey for `fame and fortune`. It was the first covid summer and since then I did and learned bunch of new things which wouldn't have happened if things were normal. This is after spending 5 months in isolation: worse year becoming the best. This is a note to the future. Not for work, but for life.

## The Covid Winter is Over
- *FoMO or Indecisiveness creates stress.* It was funny, when I woke up one morning around March 2020, during the early lock-down days and I felt so happy. There was nothing to miss, and so I was happy being inside spending time as I please. I spent bunch of time with plants, I cooked and started learning new things. These were the times when we thought the quarantine would be over soon. Now a year later things are still as bad as before if not worse.
- *Breath and look for the next thing* I don't know when it was; when I got the idea of applying for PR in Ontario and leave/sublet my place in MTL. But I guess it was important and I wasn't so overwhelmed with the Covid situation. So I looked for IELTS exam and it was difficult due to the Covid. Earliest exam was in Calgary, Alberta; so I flew there. People were surprised I was flying during the covid. Honestly given that everyone had their masks all the time; it was probably quite safe. Bars were open in Alberta, so I enjoyed my first outdoor beer after the winter in Calgary and drove to Banff and Jasper. Best time to visit and few tourists to be found. I think many people still believe flying is very bad for themselves and for the community.
- *Maybe keep your ties light* I didn't have family in Montreal, or a house that I bought or expensive furnitures. So it was relatively easy to leave. Honestly, I had a nice setup in Montreal and I could have stayed there and things would have been fine and a year would end in a blink. I guess I find it hard to imagine how that would have been. Would I gave up staying after a while anyway? Maybe this was destiny; but it was possible probably because I didn't have certain ties with Montreal, yet. And this is good and bad at the same time. It would have been sad though to live a life dreaming an alternative without seeing the beauty and opportunity in it. Maybe it is possible to have ties and think twice before having them so that you can adjust and minimize them as much as possible.

## The Alternative Covid Year
- *Miss and enjoy* So mid-august I took off and arrived to Istanbul with many plans. My return ticket was for November I think; which then got postponed until May. Istanbul had many cats and I was innocently smiling at them while running preparing for Mt Ararat. Climbing the highest point in Turkey was something I planned for a while and I executed it with my brother. Such a nice weekend and It was quite easy in hindsight to do. Here I know the people, possibilities and limits. I missed Turkey so badly, the food, the land, the sea, the language, dear friends and family. Those fish, too. Fish on grill. Again, nothing too wrong about being far for a while. It makes you miss and it makes you happy and smile when you are back. Maybe you have to leave some times to miss again.
- *Dreams I accumulated and consumed* Doing and arranging things were much easier at home. Maybe this is climate; they say Mediterranean. I did many things that I dreamed for a while. Learning riding horses, scuba diving, swimming comfortably, riding my motorbike daily, learning sailing, climbing peaks. I did all of these in 6 months maybe. Crazy when I think about it. So many years I hustled in America It feels like that I didn't do much. Now I know I can do more. I still have a home in Turkey and I need to accumulate more dreams.
- *Discovering places* Now I know the land better. For example, which small batch olive oil producer makes the best olive oil in Ayvalik. I know oil is pressed around November and taste of the fresh oil. I know Cunda and Ayvalik better and its sad history. I am a sailor. I belong to the sea as much as I belong to the mountains. Sad that I discovered see in my 28th year. I know the wonderful Bonjuk Bay community; a place to come back immediately. I know more fish types now: Akya, Levrek, Cupra, Lufer, Kalkan, Barbun, Kolyoz, Uskumru, Tekir. I know I can carry a 20kg back-pack upto Kilimanjaro. And the legend of Land Crusier. Knowing the animal kingdom on the land and in the sea better. Not scared of the sea anymore, can spend hours in it. I know I can dance 12 hours non-stop and I like that. I know the lemon tree has stings and they are up there on trees from Jan to May. Malta Plum is ready in April and figs are due October. Chestnuts are ready on December. 1k meter high mountains are 10min away to Kas and there are so may ancient cities around. I know why Kayakoy is special and where to go there when I am back. I know I have 2 summers in Turkey one in October/November and the other in March/April. O and there is Tanzania.
- *When everyone is staying maybe it is time to go* Places are beautiful and unique and we, people, ruin them most of the time. It was so special to be in Tanzania during the covid times. So special to be the first jeep to get into the Ngorongoro crated and so special to be in Kilimanjaro seeing only few people during the day. Sleeping in special camp sites in Serengeti; yeah why not. And working from Zanzibar Utupoa. Crazy times. I wished I had more time to go places during this time. I skipped Egypt and many others possibly. I worked instead. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. I should remember this. I need to stop sometimes and take the opportunity. I don't know when the next time would be; I don't know how long this life would be.
- *And the cycle repeats?* I think I got used to this. beautiful sea and the view. Delicious fish and fresh tomato. I got used to being at home but yet it feels difficult to leave. So many memories and only few of them are recorded. More to be missed. I got my Permanent residency in Canada few weeks ago. The thing that I pushed a year ago and now I have to go back to claim it. 3*365 days needs to be spent in Canada to become a citizen; which would make me a first world citizen; less borders and more opportunities. O, yes, the life is unjust and only we can do sth about it. I don't know whether I would fulfill this requirement. Maybe I would go Japan, maybe Africa or Netherlands. Australia is a good option, too. I wonder how I am going to miss here when I am back in Canada. I am sure summer will help; but winter might be tough. Covid was unexpected and made me realize a new path, a new circle. Now I know more and I am excited to discover more.
