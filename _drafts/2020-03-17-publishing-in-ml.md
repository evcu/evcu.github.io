Doing this is important and I hope it will highlight the problem, so that we can address it in the future. My rough plan for this post to keep it short as long as possible. I will talk about 2 paper submission stories and combine them with some observations. The tl/dr is:

(1) Most of the research happens in small isolated islands where people are excited to put a brick on the closest dwelling they see. Many of these dwellings have ill-foundations and therefore fall apart frequently.

(2) With the value of `research impact` being high, researchers allocate their times so that their impact (paper, citation, marketing, etc...) maximized, which unfortunately doesn't align with any reasonable goal we can attain to doing research.

($) Solution: Senior people reinforcing and prioritizing good science in every aspect of research: execution, promotion, recruiting.

Before starting I would like to talk about Goal of Research: I have never read about this, and maybe I should before posting this. But before reading I would like to reflect what I think: pure. Goal of research is about explaining things that happen. But does all phenomena created equal? No, researcher picks a topic and a question that has an importance to them. Utility? Not sure I am, although in ML this seems a requirement given that we are creating our own problems. Utility doesn't have to be immediate and worst if it is fake-news. After picking the topic and question of importance, researcher uses science to explain to phenomena and/or sometimes solves the problem. And the ultimate goal, I guess, solve more problems and explain things such that we can attack greater problems in the future.  

## Research Islands
Of course Robinson Cruse and the island we want to be during this Covid-19 isolation days is not the research islands. I submitted my first full paper `Mean Replacement Pruning` to ICLR-2019. Such a hustle. Days and nights, last minute edits coming from hospitals and the excitement and the relief. `If it looks like a paper it is a paper`, that's the duck test. Didn't know that was not the end.

- Research is not team game.
- Publishing is way to important for junior people and the funny thing it is also important for senior people too; sometimes. This is the real currency these days, noy whether you are a good reviewer or AC.
- Research for science possible? yes; but the way the great community do research effects this minority.  
- Research or marketing? Importance of selling your work. Mentioning, emailing and role of senior researchers: they are the cause and entity that can fix it.
- Why everyone is so busy?
- Way too many papers? Why? Do we really progress that fast? Or do we have bunch of half, buggy, similar papers.
