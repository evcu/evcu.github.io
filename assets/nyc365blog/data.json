I called the bash script which calls the python script, which reads my daily answers to the 4 box and 1 emotion scale, then it copies the image, updates the json file and pushes the changes. Awesome. I may remove the other part, depending on its usage. So here it is. I would like to mention my first trial of starting this blog, when I first arrive to NYC. I wrote two days using markdown but didn't continue, because it was two much to do regularly. Therefore I came up with this version of blogging. Short and compact and easy to read, I hope. So I was here in NYC and after 4 months I can say I feel much better, much more content and much more ready to discover it. Food heated again in uwave is never good! Lets see how the days evolve"

But it feels like I have to do when people appreciate my hardwork. Utku needs to be great! I feel like people are expecting. so. It is like If I fail then I am under achiever. We have a problem here: Too much thinking. Now I will get rid of the nice sentence I wrote on the whiteboard: \"I want to -> blabalbalba...small plans/what is the big thing? / why you do these.../->To be content at the end. / what else can you do ? / -> The problem is your imagination is limited by your reality. but I am the become-better-guy. I wanna be really good at software and ML.\" (but I don't feel it now, was it for a day only? haha)"

A random walk around mean. In other words there is the phenomenon of having a horrible event when things go right(like the one I had in my freshman year). I heard also similar stories from different people. There is also the thing of Nazar(evel eye) in my culture, which protects you when good things happen. Which assumes also bad things gonna follow after good things. Another follow-up practice in the culture related to that is that you bring your friends to a dinner after a great event happened in your life like getting a new job. It is all related to the thing that bad things may follow good things so yo need to do sth to prevent yourself from Nazar. Does it sound similar? Lucky events that happened to you, that suprises you, may be just luck and it is above the mean and as expected relatively bad things gonna follow-up. Especially if you got lost in to this illusion of that it wasn't by luck. But what if you worked hard and you increased your mean and good things followed. Can Nazar still happen? How would you know your mean? Frequency!"

You happen to be sad when you loosen the things since you feel happy. I feel worried about the week. But Stop. You shouldn't. It was a great day. Tea, coffee, beer and it is normal that your brain stops after a while. One wise thing I think to force yourself to shift between various activities. But no it is about being not lazy. in mind."
