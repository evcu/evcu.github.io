I called the bash script which calls the python script, which reads my daily answers to the 4 box and 1 emotion scale, then it copies the image, updates the json file and pushes the changes. Awesome. I may remove the other part, depending on its usage. So here it is. I would like to mention my first trial of starting this blog, when I first arrive to NYC. I wrote two days using markdown but didn't continue, because it was two much to do regularly. Therefore I came up with this version of blogging. Short and compact and easy to read, I hope. So I was here in NYC and after 4 months I can say I feel much better, much more content and much more ready to discover it. Food heated again in uwave is never good! Lets see how the days evolve"

A random walk around mean. In other words there is the phenomenon of having a horrible event when things go right(like the one I had in my freshman year). I heard also similar stories from different people. There is also the thing of Nazar(evel eye) in my culture, which protects you when good things happen. Which assumes also bad things gonna follow after good things. Another follow-up practice in the culture related to that is that you bring your friends to a dinner after a great event happened in your life like getting a new job. It is all related to the thing that bad things may follow good things so yo need to do sth to prevent yourself from Nazar. Does it sound similar? Lucky events that happened to you, that suprises you, may be just luck and it is above the mean and as expected relatively bad things gonna follow-up. Especially if you got lost in to this illusion of that it wasn't by luck. But what if you worked hard and you increased your mean and good things followed. Can Nazar still happen? How would you know your mean? Frequency!"

Because one part of me looks for 'trouble' and says hey that will make you feel good. You need to take risks to improve stuff! An other part of me says that it is just a room, not your life. But it effects, isn't it? I mean I would be with like minded people, then it is great! Isn't it? Complicated stuff. I am gonna focus on the exam now and then talk with Shelly later said the Zorba. No I am not the zorba"

In one of them you have all the choices and fun/burden is to pick the one (meanwhile It seems like you can have those choices only if you enjoy them). Or you have a life which has no choices and it is about accepting and keeping the default/expected. The later one is most of us. And as I said you are in between these two ends. Therefore sometimes you do it well and get the choices. But this is new and you start thinking about the options and some of us realize that the options are somehow equally likely and you choose one of those depending on your mood and context, and changing it many-times during the day. So and you may even hate this shit. How can you decide if the choices are all possible/likely and how can you be happy about your choice... So today I needed to think about some choices ven though I had an exam (they just occupy your brain!), actually two of them, one being the housing (whether to leave or not). I decided to stay, which being the default and low-risk/pasive choice. So maybe you can arrange your choices in life ortagonally, such that the mean is reasonable, huh?"
